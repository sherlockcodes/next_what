Next what??

Before netflix or amazon prime, we all used to share loads of movies through hard drives or pen drives from friends. One day, you will have 100s of movies in hard disk. But not sure what to watch next. I was there. So, wrote this simple script during my college times to see what I mostly prefer to watch based on genres, release year. Internally, it used lot of other things like imdb rating, rotten tomatoes and other meta data. 

It was fun ;)
